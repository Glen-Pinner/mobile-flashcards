# Mobile Flashcards

Third project undertaken as part of Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

The mobile application allows users to study using a collection of flashcards. The app
allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards
to those decks, and then take quizzes on those decks.

N.B. The app is NOT published on either the App Store or Google's Play store. Currently it
has been developed only for iOS and may be run on the Expo client app on a mobile phone or
the iOS simulator. 

The application can be installed and launched locally as follows:

1. Open a terminal on your local computer.
2. Navigate to a suitable folder on your local computer.
3. At the command prompt ($ below), type the following commands
   
   $ git clone https://github.com/Glen-Pinner/mobile-flashcards  
   $ cd mobile-flashcards  
   $ yarn install (please wait while dependencies download)  
   $ yarn start

4. To run the app on the Expo client on a mobile phone, perform the following steps
   
   - Download the Expo app from Apple's App store or Google's Play store if not already installed 
   - Ensure the mobile phone is connected to the computer running  
   - Open the Expo app
   - Scan the QR code
   - The app will be uploaded to the mobile phone and run

5. To run the app in the iOS simulator
   
   - Press the "i" key (lowercase i)
   - The app will be uploaded to the simulator and run

6. The application can be stopped by Ctrl-C in the terminal.
